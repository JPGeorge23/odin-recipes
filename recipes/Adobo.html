    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's been called the unofficial national dish of the Philippines. But ask anyone of Filipino heritage how to make their beloved chicken adobo, and everyone will give you a different answer. And they're all correct.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 head of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>4-6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, white vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken thighs to the marinade and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat the canola oil over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade and shake off any excess. Reserve the marinade.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, add the chicken to the skillet or Dutch oven and brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Return all of the chicken to the skillet or Dutch oven, add the reserved marinade and enough water to cover the chicken. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the bay leaf and serve the chicken over rice, garnished with green onions or cilantro if desired.</li>
    </ol>
